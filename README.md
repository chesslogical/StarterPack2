## Starter Pack 2

1- A nice Cryptographically Secure key maker. Generates a detailed report to prove it, too! 

2- Simple xor encryption. Why? Because 99 percent of AES apps are silly and absurdly flawed, that's why. To test if AES actually works properly, 
you encrypt a file, then encrypt it again. Then decrypt it, then decrypt it again. IF the original file shows up and is not encrypted, guess what? That is NOT how the AES algo is supposed to work, and the app you are using is NOT AES encryption. Literally, 99 percent of all AES apps that i have tested have this distinct flaw which indicates that it is not proper AES encryption at all- it is a half assed encryption app that others claim is true AES encryption.
